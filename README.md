## ELECTION-AUDIT SUMMARY

The script used for this audit is highly malleable and can be applied to any election data with only slight modification. Any changes would be made to the titles of sourced datasets within the script. With slight changes the script can also be used to obtain data on female vs. male voters as well as voter age, given that the information is provided in the CSV.
